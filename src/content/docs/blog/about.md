大家好！我是 Rogerogers。

Hello everyone! I'm Rogerogers, and my full English name is Rogers David.

I'm a full-stack development engineer and also a practitioner in the DevOps
field. I have been deeply involved in the development field for many years
and have accumulated rich experience.

I enjoy solving various technical problems and am capable of handling
various complex development tasks.

I'm very passionate about open source. I firmly believe that open source can
promote the development of technology and actively participate in the
contribution of open source projects. Currently, I'm a member of the [CloudWeGo](https://github.com/cloudwego) community and an Approver of the website project.

In life, I like DC comics. Those wonderful stories and distinct characters
always immerse me and bring me a lot of creative inspiration.

Looking forward to continuing to move forward on the road of technology in
the future and constantly break through myself!
